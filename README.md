# Two-Voice-Poetry

**Summary**
Two Voice Poetry was created to replicate the recitation of a two-voice poem with Amazon Lex. The bot can be used in lieu of a second person as a speaker when creating a two voice poem. A poem was created with the intent to create a semi-generated piece of poetry where the bot can respond to the user. While many of the possible intents are free-form, sample utterances are provided and some verse require specific phrases for the interaction to work.

To run the project, copy the project2.py file into the lambda console on Amazon’s aws page (https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?region=us-east-1). Then use the bigStretch, iwalk, overUnder, smile, and times jpg files to copy the bot intents into Amazon lex.

A sample of the interaction can be found out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpDwgaLsjJQ

Two voice poetry is generally not a commonly published work, but can be a remarkable experience to have with another or to see in person. Given the circumstances of 2020, many have not had the opportunity to share such interactions. This poem was inspired by life, death, and nature and the chance encounters that we could have and the chance for novel interactions.
