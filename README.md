# Two-Voice-Poetry

**Summary**
Two Voice Poetry was created to replicate the recitation of a two-voice poem with Amazon Lex. The bot can be used in lieu of a second person as a speaker when creating a two voice poem. A poem was created with the intent to create a semi-generated piece of poetry where the bot can respond to the user. While many of the possible intents are free-form, sample utterances are provided and some verse require specific phrases for the interaction to work.

To run the project, copy the project2.py file into the lambda console on Amazon’s aws page (https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?region=us-east-1). Then use the bigStretch, iwalk, overUnder, smile, and times jpg files to copy the bot intents into Amazon lex.

Two voice poetry is generally not a commonly published so
