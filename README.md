# Two-Voice-Poetry

**Summary**
Two Voice Poetry was created to replicate the recitation of a two-voice poem with Amazon Lex. The bot can be used in lieu of a second person as a speaker when creating a two voice poem. A poem was created with the intent to create a semi-generated piece of poetry where the bot can respond to the user. While many of the possible intents are free-form, sample utterances are provided and some verse require specific phrases for the interaction to work.

To run the project, copy the project2.py file into the lambda console on amazonâ€™s aws page (https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?region=us-east-1). Then use the jpg file to copy the bot intents into amazon lex.
